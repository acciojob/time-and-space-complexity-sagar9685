	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity measures how the execution time of an algorithm grows relative to the input size (n)â€”used to analyze and compare algorithm efficiency.</p>
		<p> <b> Space Complexity </b> O(n) means the algorithm uses extra memory that grows linearly with the input size n.</p>
