<h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
	<p>
    Time complexity refers to how the execution time of an algorithm increases with the size of the input. It helps determine how efficient an algorithm is.
  </p>

	 <p>
    <b>Space Complexity</b> measures the amount of extra memory an algorithm uses as the input size grows. An example is O(n), which means memory usage increases linearly with input size.
